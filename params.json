{"name":"PyRadarMet","tagline":"Python Fundamental Calculations for Radar Meteorology","body":"### Welcome to PyRadarMet!\r\nThis software package offers a number of basic weather radar calculations in a pure python environment. Many of the functions are general use radar routines.\r\n\r\n### News\r\nThis module has be ported over to an [R package](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/radar/) by Jose Gama.<br>\r\nAlso, PyRadarMet is undergoing a port into the [wradlib](http://wradlib.bitbucket.org/) python package.<br>\r\nMost fundamental modules are (or have been) ported currently into both packages.<br>\r\nSpecial packages (e.g. BeamBlock, ZDR cal scripts) are currently only available in PyRadarMet.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nAuthored by Nick Guy (@nguy)<br><br>\r\nContributors:<br>\r\nTimothy Lang (@tjlang)<br>\r\nKai Muehlbauer (@kmuehlbauer)\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nThere are two options for install.  The setup script now downloads the data listed below\r\nautomatically.<br>\r\nTo download and install the data within the package directory:\r\n\r\n```python\r\npython setup.py install\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is the most robust way, as the data is always a relative path stored within the python 'egg'.\r\n\r\nTo download the data and install it to a user-specified location an environmental variable must be set.\r\nThe variable is 'GTOPO_DATA' and can be set on unix systems (in a bash environment) as such:\r\n```python\r\nexport GTOPO_DATA=/some/direcoty/for/the/data\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is recommended that this be done in a shell profile file like .bashrc or .bash_profile \r\nThen run the install command:\r\n```python\r\npython setup.py install\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe install took about 150 seconds on a university connection when installed in an external directory.\r\n\r\nThe install took about 250 seconds when installed as part of the package.\r\n\r\n### Data\r\nThe data folder holds Digital Elevation Model data used in the BeamBlock routine.\r\nThe data is the GTOPO30, a 30-arc second (~ 1 km) elevation data set.  \r\nData available from the U.S. Geological Survey.\r\nDownloaded from the [long term archive](https://lta.cr.usgs.gov/), using the [EarthExplorer](http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/) tool.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
