This scripts directory contains executables that may be useful for radar processing.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CALCULATIONS/ANALYSIS:
cal_zdr - Lets the user calculate the ZDR bias of a dual polarimetric radar.
zdral_3panel - Produces vertical plots of reflectivity, differential reflectivity,
               and standard deviation of ZDR.  These can be modified by user.
----------------------------------------
These programs can be used from the command line in one of two ways.
Note: Just substitute zdrcal_3panel for cal_zdr 
For a single file, if you want a plot output:

$ cal_zdr --{filetype} -p "{filename}"

See the help file for filetypes accepted and the filename can be a long path.

For multiple files:

$ cal_zdr --{filetype} -p "{filename_search_path}"

the filename_search_path can be something like KTLX* and all files in that
directory will be processed.  

There is a check for ZDRCal, but not sure how robust it is at this time.  Note this has
been commented out as there is little consistency in naming conventions
between radar systems.

The executable can be modified with 3 different thresholds at the top of the 
file to control what data to keep for analysis.

LIST SIGMET RAW FILE CHARACTERISTICS:
listfile_raw.py - Create a list of characteristics for file(s) and output to screen 
or output file

$ listfile_raw.py -m "{filename_search_path}" "{output_filename}"
